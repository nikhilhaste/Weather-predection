# AIM
The goal of weather prediction is to provide information people and organizations
can use to reduce weather-related losses and enhance societal benefits, including
protection of life and property, public health and safety, and support of economic
prosperity and quality of life. In economic terms, the benefit of the investment in
public weather forecasts and warnings is substantial: the estimated annualized
benefit is about $31.5 billion, compared to the $5.1 billion cost of generation the
information.

# PROJECT SCOPE

The main aim of this project is predict the weather report and should be useful for
all kind of peoples. Based on this type of application we can avoid unwanted
weather related problem. The Linear Regression algorithm, which is used to
forecast weather using these data, is at the center of this project, the higher the
precision, the more parameters considered. This project has the potential to assist
a large number of people in predicting tomorrow's weather. Temperature, dew,
pressure, and humidity are simply used to train the data in this project. These data
are then used to train a prediction model using Linear Regression.
